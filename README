NAME
    RT::Extension::AttachmentZip - Download Attachments from RT Ticket

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension for Best Practical's Request Tracker
    http://www.bestpractical.com/rt

    This extension permits you to download the attachments associated with a ticket as a zip file.

    There are two options:

    1) current
    2) all

    Current mode downloads just the most recent revision of the attached file
    All mode downloads _all_ the revisions, and prepends the revision id number to the filename.

INSTALLATION

    make
    make install
        May need root permissions
